# aido

Implementation of a (toy) command called `aido` (A.I. Do, like... sudo - Super User Do) that receives an input in natural language and converts it into a valid Linux (Ubuntu, in this case) command using the OpenAI API.

![Example](./example.png)

The prompt can be written in Brazilian Portuguese as well, to better suit your preferences!

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

This script uses the OpenAI API. Therefore, you should create an OpenAI API account, obtain an API key, and set that key as an environment variable before executing it. To get your API key, access https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and set it in the environment using:

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

## Use

Execute with python:

```
python3 aido.py <Your prompt>
```

Replace `<Your prompt>` with the natural language input that you want to convert into a Linux command. For example:

```
python3 aido.py "Exibir o conteÃºdo do arquivo texto.txt"
```

This will convert the input "Exibir o conteÃºdo do arquivo texto.txt" into a valid Linux command using the OpenAI API.

## If you really like this command ðŸ˜œ

You can install it in your system by copying it to a directory in your $PATH, such as /usr/bin. To do this, run the following commands:

```
chmod +x aido.py
sudo cp aido.py /usr/bin/aido
```

Note that you may need to use sudo to copy the file to a directory owned by the root user.

After this, you can use it anywhere in your system:

```
aido <Your prompt>
```

Like in the last example, replace <Your prompt> with the natural language input that you want to convert into a Linux command.
